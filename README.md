This project is a C-based database system for managing airline-related information, including airports, flights, passengers, and reservations. It supports multiple query operations over the stored data, allowing efficient retrieval and analysis of information.

The system includes an interactive terminal application built with ncurses, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring and querying the database. A strong emphasis was placed on encapsulation and modular design, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities between components, improved maintainability, and safer data access.
